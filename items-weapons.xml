<!-- 
Colander Arch
Weapon (any bow), rare (requires attunement)

This bow is cooked mainly by the pastafolk of the Pengriata region, and the silver sieve in the 
middle is enchanted by the priests of Tarif (p. 59) with divine magic.
You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
Sieving Shot (Requires Attunement). This bow has 3 charges. By speaking its command phrase, "Sieve
out!", as part of your Attack action, you can shoot three beams of light at targets within 100 feet 
of you that
you can see instead of making a normal weapon attack. You can shoot them at one target or several. 
Each beam deals 1d6 force damage on a hit. This bow regains all
expended charges daily at dawn.

Elemental Rolling Pin
Weapon (rolling pin), uncommon

This wooden rolling pin has carved runes and magical glyphs that can wield elemental powers. At 
each dawn, you can choose one of the following attributes:
Air. Until the next dawn, whenever you make a successful weapon attack with this weapon, you can 
use your reaction to cause the weapon to release a magical force. When you do, the target must 
succeed on a DC l2 Strength saving throw or be pushed back 5 feet to an unoccupied space.
Earth. The weapon deals an extra ld6 acid damage on each hit until the next dawn.
Fire. The weapon deals an extra ld4 fire damage on each hit until the next dawn. Also, you can 
speak this weapon's command word (requires no action), causing it to shed bright light in a l0-foot 
radius and dim light for an additional l0 feet.
Water. The weapon deals an extra ld4 cold damage on each hit until the next dawn. Also, while you 
are holding this weapon, you have swimming speed equal to your walking speed.
Flame Ice Weapon
Weapon (any melee), very rare
You deal an extra ld6 cold damage with successful
weapon attacks you make with this magic weapon made from flame ice. Also, when you hit a creature 
with this weapon, the icy structure of the weapon splinters,
and flames escape from the cracks; the weapon gains a charge. The weapon can hold up to 3 charges 
and loses a charge each round as it repairs itself. For each
charge it holds, you deal an extra ld6 fire damage with successful weapon attacks you make with 
this weapon.

Fork of the Slithering Dragon
Weapon (warfork), very rare (requires attunement)

This magic weapon was crafted to slay dragons by the master crafters of the Fridge region. It is 
imbued with a magical effect that is especially harmful to dragons.
You have a +l bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This bonus becomes +2 
when the fork is used against a dragon. Additionally, you can use your action to charge at a 
creature within 30 feet of you in a straight line. When you do, you move at a very high speed, 
difficult terrain doesn't slow you down, and you have advantage on saving throws against traps
until the end of your turn. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your 
Strength modifier
+ your proficiency bonus) or you strike it with the fork after your charge, dealing ld8 piercing 
damage plus 2d6 force damage. If the target is a dragon, the fork makes a booming sound that only 
dragons can hear, dealing an
additional 2d6 thunder damage to the target.

Golden Celery
Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement)

Made out of gold and iron, this magic longsword resembles a celery stalk with a handle. It is said 
that the golden celery was used by a great warrior in the War of the Frying Pan against the molded 
armies of the Green Witch. According to the legend, the warrior
fought against hundreds of monsters alone and became victorious, single-handedly saving many 
innocent lives.
You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Additionally, on a hit, 
golden celery leaves erupt from the stalk, dealing 3d6 radiant damage to hostile creatures within 5 
feet of the target.
Gum Bullet
Weapon (sling bullet), uncommon
This small, light blue capsule breaks on impact, releasing sticky gum onto the target. If a 
creature takes damage from the sling bullet, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or 
become restrained until freed; a Large or larger creature automatically succeeds on the saving 
throw. A creature within 5 feet of the restrained creature, including itself, can remove the gum 
using an action, freeing the creature.

Knafeh
Weapon (greataxe), artifact (requires attunement)

The old sages prophesized the events leading to the world's end, when the Great Eater shall take 
four
bites to devour all. These prophecies were never transcribed, and many have been forgotten over 
time. One prophecy, however, has managed to survive to this day: the one that foretold how the end 
of days could be averted. One variation of the legend is as follows:
The son of sugar and cheese shall fall in love with the daughter of pistachio and kataifi; and 
their adoration shall create a prodigy. With the vigor of sugar, the wisdom of cheese, the courage 
of pistachios and the kindness of the kataifi, the prodigy alone shall wield a weapon, made in the 
image of its own body. When the artifact and the prodigy finally become one, the endless meal of 
the Great Eater shall be done.
You gain a +4 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the weapon 
ignores resistance to slashing damage.
You gain the following features while holding the weapon.
Vigor. When you take the Attack action, you can make one additional weapon attack with this weapon.
Wisdom. When you fail a Wisdom saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. Once this feature 
is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
Courage. You are immune to being frightened.
Kindness. When you roll for initiative, you can choose to place yourself at the top of the 
initiative order, but you must try to end the conflict through persuasion on your first turn in 
combat; you can't take hostile actions on that turn.
Destroying This Artifact. This artifact can only be
destroyed if it is fed to the Great Eater.

Lollyaxe
Weapon (greataxe), rare

Crafted from the salvaged sugary rocks of Sugarwater Run (p. 113) and enchanted by the hammers of 
skillful weaponsmiths, the lollyaxe is a deadly delight.
As a bonus action, you can lick the axe to activate it. The next time you hit a creature with this 
weapon, you mark the target for 3 rounds. The critical range of
attacks made against the marked creature increases by
1. To elaborate, if your attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, your attacks against a 
marked creature score a critical hit on a roll of 18, 19, or 20. Only one creature can be marked in 
this way at a time.

Marking Throwing Pick
Weapon (throwing pick), rare (requires attunement)

This metal pick is imbued with magic for the best of hunters. You have a +1 bonus to attack and 
damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Also, this weapon has 4 charges. When you hit a creature, 
you can use a reaction to expend 1 charge to cast the hunter’s mark (1st-level version) spell on 
the target, except the spell doesn't require concentration and you can't mark another creature when 
the target drops to 0 hit points. Do not add the extra damage of the hunter’s mark spell for the 
attack that triggered your reaction. The marking
throwing pick regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.
You can recall the throwing pick into your free hand if it's within 300 feet of you (no action 
required by you), at which point it reappears
In your hand.
Mop
Weapon (quarterstaff), uncommon
The mop has 6 charges for the following property. It regains 1 expended charge whenever you 
successfully deal 5 or more damage to an ooze using this weapon.
Squeeze Out. While holding the weapon, you can use an action to squeeze out the accumulated liquid 
from the mop and expend 3 charges. When you do so, a filth ooze (p. 155) appears in an unoccupied 
space within 5 feet of you; if there are no unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of you, you can't use 
this feature. The filth ooze is friendly to you and your companions. In combat, roll initiative 
separately for the ooze, which acts on its own turns. The filth ooze can understand simple commands 
such as move, attack, and defend, and it does its best
to obey your verbal commands (no actions required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the 
filth ooze, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. It melts into 
a dirty liquid after an
hour or when it drops to 0 hit point

Sizzling Pan
Weapon (frying pan or great frying pan), uncommon

The sizzling pan is the favorite weapon of many mercenaries in the Great Pistachio Empire (p. 80). 
When you hit a creature with this weapon, it heats up and gains a charge. If the weapon doesn't 
gain a charge for 1 minute, it loses all its charges. When the weapon has 3 charges, it bursts into 
flames, loses all of its charges, deals an additional 2d6 fire damage to any target it
hits for 1 minute, and can't gain any charges for the duration.
Sugar-Coated Weapon
Weapon (any), uncommon (requires attunement)
Sugar-coated weapons were created by the priests of Krunch (p. 57) who coat weapons with sacred 
sugar. Creating enough sacred sugar to coat a weapon is a long and exhausting process that takes a 
month. A priest must pray and sing hymns while holding a cup of sugar for a month, blowing at the 
cup after each verse. After the process, blacksmiths caramelize the sacred sugar and coat weapons 
with it.
A sugar-coated weapon is a magic weapon that deals an extra 1d4 acid or radiant damage (determined 
by the GM when you first acquire the weapon) to any target it
hits.
