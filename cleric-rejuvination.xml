            <p>Rejuvenation is the form of energy that suffuses and awakens the universe, and keeps the foodfolk of Silverplate going. Forces of rejuvenation provide coffee, fresh fruit, clear water, and all other types of food that symbolize awakening, freshness, and purification. Their clerics know that it is their responsibility to provide such rejuvenation to those in need and to protect the fresh sources. They are aware that it is one of the greatest responsibilities one's shoulders can bear. </p>
