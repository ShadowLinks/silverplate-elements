            <p>Your power comes from the faint flavor deep within you. It is a rare variety of spice bequeathed by your early ancestors or seasoned within you by an entity. Regardless, you know how power tastes, and the more you understand your own taste, the more you understand the power within. Understanding spice is understanding the foodfolk and how to season them to your liking. </p>

As a reaction, while casting a spell, choose up to 3 willing creatures within 30 feet and spend 1 sorcerer point for each creature.

            <ul>
