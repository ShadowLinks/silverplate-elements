<!--  
Apple of Immunity
Wondrous Item, legendary (requires attunement)

This green magical orb looks like a glass apple ornament. While holding it, you can use your bonus 
action to speak its command word and cause the apple to hover around you. While the apple is 
hovering around you, whenever you take damage, you can use
your reaction to take no damage instead. Once you do, you have immunity to the damage types 
prevented by the reaction until the next dawn. Whenever you are subjected to the said damage type, 
you regain 1d4 hit points instead of taking damage.
Once used, the globe can't be used in this way again until the next dawn.
Chopsticks of Extension
Wondrous item, uncommon
You can use the chopsticks to manipulate creatures from a distance. You can affect creatures within 
300 feet that are also at least 120 feet away from you. As an action, you can use the chopsticks to 
hold a creature and move it. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or it moves 
10 feet in a direction of your choice. Large creatures have advantage on
this saving throw, and Huge or larger creatures automatically succeed on it.
Cotton Candy Vase
Wondrous Item, common
Foodfolk of Silverplate use this vase both for decorative
and culinary purposes.
When you plant a seed inside, it grows twice as fast as its expected growing speed. The leaves of 
the plants growing inside this vase are cotton candy, although their fruit (if they bear any) is 
ordinary.
Fiery Oven Mitts
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
These mitts look like regular oven mitts with red runes on them. When you wear these mitts, you are 
protected from fire. You have resistance to fire damage.
When you make an unarmed attack while wearing the mitts, they blaze with fire and fury. Your 
successful unarmed attacks made with your hands deal an additional 1d6 fire damage.

Jell-Y-Suit
Wondrous item, rare (+1), very rare (+2), or legendary (+3) (requires attunement)
This wondrous item is a tiny jelly bean with protective powers. As part of attuning to it, you must 
swallow the bean; the jelly bean stays inside you as long as you are attuned. If your attunement to 
this item ends, you throw up the bean.
Sticky Skin (requires attunement). As an action, you can speak the command word to summon the jelly 
if you are not wearing any armor. When you do so, a thin layer of jelly with the flavor of your 
choice covers your skin. While wearing the jelly, you gain a bonus to AC according to the rarity of 
the jelly bean. You are not
considered to be wearing armor while protected in this way. The jelly retreats back inside you if 
you put on armor or if you command it as a bonus action.
Lettuce Cloak
Wondrous Item, uncommon
Woven from big, magical lettuce leaves, the lettuce cloak
is a popular piece of gear among novice adventurers. Whenever you are targeted with a nonmagical 
weapon attack that you are aware of while wearing this cloak, you can use your reaction to increase 
your AC by 1 against the attack.
Mask of Eternal Might
Wondrous Item, very rare (requires attunement)
These ornate masks are made of gold and covered with tiny gems of every color. They are incredibly 
alluring, emitting a captivating glow that draws in anyone who gazes upon them. These masks are 
both a blessing and a curse created by the ancient agents of the God of Trickery (p. 56).
When you wear this mask, all of your ability scores increase by 2. You don't need to eat, drink or 
sleep to sustain yourself. You can change the appearance of the mask as you please as a bonus 
action.
Also, if you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. Once used, the mask of eternal 
might
can't be used in this way again until the next dawn.
Curse. The curse is activated at a random time determined by the GM each week. When the curse is 
activated, you must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you 
postpone the curse until next week. On a failed save, your body
is petrified and turns into a mass of hardened cake for 1d4+3 days; you cannot choose to succeed on 
the saving throw using the mask. During this time, you
stay attuned to the item. If you stay petrified for seven days straight, the petrified condition on 
you becomes permanent.
Only a wish spell cast on you ends the petrified condition. Once you are attuned to the item, you 
cannot end the attunement unless a remove curse spell is cast on you.
Necklace of Temperature
Wondrous Item, very rare (requires attunement)
This golden necklace decorated with rubies and sapphires is crafted to protect the wearer against 
extreme temperatures. While wearing the necklace, you are immune to being burnt or frozen (p. 47). 
Also, when you take fire or cold damage, you can choose to end the necklace's immunity effects and 
negate the damage as
a reaction. If you do so, the necklace loses its magical properties until the next dawn.
Pomegrenade
Wondrous item, uncommon
As an action, you can throw this pomegranate-shaped grenade up to 30 feet, causing it to explode 
upon colliding with a solid surface. If there is a creature at the point of impact, it must make a 
DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on 
a successful one. After the first explosion, thousands of little pomegrenades spawn from the bigger 
one and fly toward the adjacent spaces. Each creature within 10 feet of the explosion (except the 
one at the impact point) must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 12d4 thunder damage on a 
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This item is destroyed after it explodes.
Robe of Napkins
Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)
This soft, white robe is designed to protect its wearer against unwanted accidents. While wearing 
this robe, any damage you take is dealt to the robe instead. The robe of napkins has 20 hit points, 
resistance to cold damage, and vulnerability to fire damage. When its hit points are reduced to 0, 
the robe withers away and
reappears on you at the next dawn. Any excess damage
carries over to you.

Sprinkles of Wayfinding
Wondrous Item, uncommon

This small pouch contains 1d4 + 4 pinches of colorful magical sprinkles. You can use an action to 
scatter a pinch in front of you and speak the name of a place. The magical sprinkles form a line in 
the air leading to the named location. If there are multiple places with the same name, the 
sprinkles form a path toward the closest one. A single pinch can only form a 10-mile line. If the 
place is protected against divination spells such as the nondetection spell or is located in a 
different plane of existence than the one you are currently in, the scattered sprinkles fall to the 
ground and don't show a path. The magical line created by the sprinkles disappears after a day.

Strawberry of Resistance
Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement)

At first glance, this magical red orb looks like a glass strawberry ornament. When you become 
attuned to it, it starts to hover around you and protect you against a single type of damage. 
Whenever you take damage, you can use your reaction to halve the damage. Once you do, you have 
resistance to one of the damage types (of your choice) that were halved by the reaction for the 
next hour.
Once used, the globe can't be used in this way again until the next dawn.
Sugarwater Incense
Wondrous Item, rare
Made of herbs, spices, and pine-wood powder that has been soaked in Sugarwater Run (p. 113) for a 
year and dried, this item is considered sacred by the pilgrims of Silverplate.
The incense itself is black; however, its sweet- smelling smoke has a soft pink color. When it is 
ignited, it creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of smoke centered
on the burning incense. The sphere spreads around corners and lasts for 1 hour.
Creatures who are exposed to the smoke for 1 minute must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving 
throw or be affected by it. A creature may also willingly choose to be affected by the incense.
Affected creatures are immune to being charmed or frightened. Whenever an affected creature tries 
to deal damage, it must roll a d100. On a result of 51-100, the creature cannot take the action and 
its turn ends. Affected creatures have a +2 bonus to Wisdom checks.
The effects end on a creature if it moves out of the area, or when the incense burns out at the end 
of 1 hour. If a creature succeeds on the saving throw, it is
immune to the incense for the next 24 hours.
Sundae Cherry Piece
Wondrous item, artifact

The cherry on top of the Sundae Mountain (p. 136) is a magical mystery placed upon the summit by 
the victorious sundae rebels. Its origin and the methods
of its transportation to the highest peak are unknown. One bite from the enormous cherry is rumored 
to bestow eternal life and wisdom.
The sundae cherry piece can't be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical 
scrying sensors.
It takes 5 bites to consume one piece in its entirety. A creature gains the following features 
according to the number of bites it takes from the sundae cherry:
One Bite. All ability scores of the creature increase by 2, up to a maximum of 22.
Two Bites. The creature becomes immortal. It doesn't age and can't be aged magically.
Three Bites. The creature becomes immune to being charmed, frightened, and petrified, and it has 
immunity to all diseases.
Four Bites. The creature doesn't need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe.
Five Bites. The creature dies and its body is destroyed. It can't be brought back to life by any 
means. Its soul is trapped within the cherry, the missing parts of which reappear at the top of 
Sundae Mountain.

War Chef’s Apron
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
While you are wearing this magical white apron, you gain the following benefits:
•  You have proficiency with kitchen weaponry.
•  You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with kitchen weaponry.
•  Your successful melee weapon attacks made with kitchen weaponry deal an extra 2d6 damage of one 
of the following damage types of your choice: acid, cold, fire, or poison.

Wet Wipes
Wondrous item, uncommon
This item is found in magical boxes that each contain 1d8 + 2 wet wipes. You can pull out a wet 
wipe from its box as part of your movement, and once it's taken out of the box, it loses its 
magical properties at the end
of an hour, becoming an ordinary wipe. As an action, you can use a wet wipe to clean a Medium or 
smaller foodfolk corpse, which immediately destroys the
corpse, turning it into a stain on the wet wipe.
