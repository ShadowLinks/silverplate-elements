Extra Virgin Olive Oil
Potion, uncommon

When you drink one bottle of this extra virgin olive oil, the tasteless condition (p. 47) ends on
you and you have garlic breath until you finish a short or long rest. While you have garlic breath,
you can use the following feature:
Exhale Garlic Breath. As a bonus action, you exhale poisonous breath in a 15-foot cone. Each
creature in the area must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 3
rounds. Once you use this feature, you no longer have garlic breath.

Potion of Bursting Flavors
Potion, uncommon

When you drink this potion, you gain immunity to becoming tasteless (p. 47) for 1 hour. If you are
already tasteless when you drink this potion, the condition ends, but you don't gain immunity to
it.

Red Hot Chili Poison
Potion, rare
This flaming hot, crimson-colored poison made from the extract of red chili pepper seeds is used by
foul foodfolk who do not hesitate to inflict pain on their foes to get what they want.
After ingesting this poison, a creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have
vulnerability to fire damage for 1 minute. At the start of each of its turns for 1d6 rounds, the
creature takes 2d6 fire damage whether it succeeded on the saving throw
or not, burning from the inside.
