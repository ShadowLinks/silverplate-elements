Whenever a creature successfully makes a bite attack against you, devours you, or consumes you in any other way, it takes 1d10 poison damage.</p>

By spending 1 hour and dealing 5 necrotic damage to yourself, which can't be reduced by any means, you can extract a vial of poison. You can pour 1 vial of this poison on a weapon to coat it with the poison for 1 minute. For the duration, successful weapon attacks made with a weapon coated with this poison deal an extra 1d4 poison damage.A weapon can only be coated with one vial of this poison at a time. An extracted vial of poison expires after 1 day. Once you extract a vial of poison, you can't extract it again until you finish a long rest. </p>
