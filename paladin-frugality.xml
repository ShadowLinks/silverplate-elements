        <description>
            <p>In a world where the cycle begins within a divine kitchen and ends with a devouring bite, frugality is a virtue. The realms are created through great efforts of the divine with limited resources. One must thus be careful and frugal in expending them. The paladins following the ideals of frugality act effectively and never back down before completing a task at hand. These paladins consort with every kind of entity and deity if they believe that it will facilitate their efforts. </p>
             <h5 class="caption">TENETS OF FRUGALITY</h5>
            <p>A paladin who takes this oath carries four grains of rice, each carved with a symbol of one of the four tenets. </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Never Waste an Opportunity.</i></b>
                 When it's obvious that the use of a resource will yield better results, use it. The tenet's symbol is two arrows standing side by side, pointing in opposite directions. 
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Donâ€™t be Wasteful.</i></b>
                 Plan ahead and be precise about your expenditure; don't waste any resources unnecessarily. The tenet's symbol is a droplet.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Complete the Task.</i></b>
                If you are out hunting a creature, kill it; showing mercy at the last moment means the waste of every resource you have spent hunting the prey down. This applies to all tasks. Stay on them and aim to finish in the most efficient way unless doing so becomes impossible or irrelevant. The tenet's symbol is a cross mark.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Protect the Cycle.</i></b>
                All creatures are made with the resources constituting the realm and those resources must eventually return to the realm. Make sure those who seek or achieve immortality perish. Even gods must die at some point. The tenet's symbol is three arrows chasing each other in a circular pattern.
            </p>

            <p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><i>Emergency Resources.</i></strong> You can use your Channel Divinity to restore magic to your magic items. As a part of your short rest, you focus divine magic on the items that you are attuned to. If those items have any charges that replenish under certain conditions, such as regaining some of them at dawn, they regain all expended charges. If the items have features that require you to finish a long rest to use them again, you are considered to have finished a long rest for the sole purpose of using those items' features again; you don't gain any other benefits of a long rest. </li>
                <li><strong><i>Recycle.</i></strong> You can use your Channel Divinity to regain resources that you and your allies have recently spent. As an action, you wave your hand in a general direction where you and your allies have spent resources. All nonmagical items and objects that you and your allies have expended within the last 10 minutes return to you and your allies in their former conditions; for example, a broken arrow returns to the ally who shot it and it is mended. The total worth of the items restored in this manner can't exceed 1,000 gp.</li>
