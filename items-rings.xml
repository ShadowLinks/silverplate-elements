Devouring Ring
Ring, legendary (requires attunement)

According to legend, long ago in a now-forgotten village, there lived a tyrannical mayor. Everyone
in the village hated the mayor since they lived in horrible
conditions. However, the villagers were too scared to do anything because the mayor was a mighty
spellcaster that could pulverize the entire village with a single spell.
One day, the youngest daughter of the village baker decided to do something, but none of the other
foodfolk would help her. She knew she couldn't overthrow the mayor alone, so she begged the gods to
help her. Alas, no gods heard her prayers. She prayed to the Cook and the Baker. Once again, her
prayers went unanswered.
Years went by, and one day the mayor came for the girl's family. Desperate to help them, she prayed to the Great Eater as a last resort, asking the
entity to devour the mayor once and for all. The mayor laughed in disbelief, but at that very
moment, a dark cloud erupted from the girl, smashing everything around
her. The mayor gazed upon the young girl in fear while dark clouds gathered around her hand and
formed
an obsidian ring. Following her instinct, the baker's daughter rushed to the mayor, touched the
tyrant's face, and the dark clouds reemerged from the ring in the form of a huge, sharp-toothed maw
that devoured the mayor, ending the evil rule that had destroyed so many lives. Believing she had
become a hero, the girl looked around expecting to find cheering foodfolk, but was met with the
terrified looks on the villagers' faces, looking at her like she was some kind of monster. So she
left the village she had saved, wearing the obsidian ring that was aptly named the devouring ring.
This ring has 10 charges and it regains 1d8 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing this
ring, you can expend its charges to use the following features:
•  Devour (5 Charges). As an action, you can touch a creature and command the ring to devour it. If
the creature you touched has 50 hit points or less, it is engulfed by a dark cloud maw and dies.
Creatures devoured in this way can't be resurrected by any means.
•  Dark Clouds (4 Charges). You cast the circle of death
spell (DC 15).
•  Fleeting Glimpse (2 Charges). You cast the misty step
spell.
•  Eater’s Protection (1 Charge). You cast the shield
spell.

Curse. This ring is cursed with the unending hunger of the Great Eater. Once you are attuned to
this ring, you can't take it off. Only a wish spell can lift the curse. When you complete a long
rest while cursed, you become driven by a dark hunger that can only be
satiated by killing a humanoid creature with the Devour action. While you have dark hunger, you
can't benefit from long rests. In addition, if you die while wearing this ring, you are devoured by
dark clouds and you can't be resurrected by any means.


Red Ring of the Ox
Ring, rare (requires attunement)

This ring infuses you with vigilance and energy, keeping you active and ready. You gain a +3 bonus
to initiative while wearing it.
The ring has 3 charges and regains all of its expended charges daily at dawn. You can expend 1
charge to cast the feather fall spell.

Ring of Banana Peels
Ring, very rare (requires attunement)

This golden magic ring looks like two bananas forming a circle. While wearing this ring, you gain a
+1 bonus to saving throws.
This ring has 6 charges and regains 3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use an action to
expend 1 charge and speak its command word. Once you do
so, choose a point within 60 feet of you. A barrage of banana peels blast out from the chosen
point, causing a30-foot radius centered on it to become difficult terrain.
When a creature walks in this area for the first time on a turn, it must succeed on a DC 15
Dexterity saving throw or step on a banana peel and fall prone, taking
4d4 bludgeoning damage. The banana peels stay on the ground for 1 minute, then disappear.

Ring of Mold Repelling
Ring, rare (requires attunement)
These magical silver rings are used by many adventurers and warriors in their battles with mold
creatures. It has a magic-infused glass sphere attached to it that repels molded monsters. The ring
has 4 charges. It regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.
You can expend 1 charge as an action. When you do so, each creature that is considered "molded"
(such as molded ones (p. 235), mold oozes (p. 230), molded
giants (p. 233), etc.) within 60 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become
repelled for 1 minute or until they take any damage. A repelled creature can't willingly move
toward you while within 30 feet of you.


Ring of Multiplication
Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)
Mostly used by lone adventurers, this silver ring makes an illusory copy of its wearer. It has 3
charges and it regains 1d4 - 1 (minimum 1) expended charges daily
at dawn. You can expend 1 charge as a bonus action to create a translucent copy of yourself in an
unoccupied space adjacent to you.
Your copy has the same game statistics as you and
carries the same magic items as you, except it has 10 hit points, and it can only make one weapon
attack and do nothing else on its turn. Your copy wields the same weapons as you but they are not
magical in any way.
Your copy takes its turn immediately after you and at the end of its turn, it disappears.

Ring of Preservation
Ring, rarity varies (requires attunement)
This golden ring has a little jar on it. When you wear it, you gain the following benefits
according to the gemstone set within the jar.
Ruby (Uncommon). You have advantage on saving throws made against being burnt or frozen (p. 47).
Jade (Rare). You are immune to being burnt or frozen.
Sapphire (Very Rare). You are immune to being burnt, frozen, or tasteless. You also have advantage
on Constitution saving throws.

Ring of Time Mastery
Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)
This silver ring has twenty-four runes inscribed on it, representing each hour of the day. When you
wear it, you can instinctively sense exactly what time it is. Also, you instinctively sense when
it's time for something you are planning to do. For example, you sense when it's time to add water
to a dish you're cooking, or you sense the right time to take your medication. Chefs use
this item to cook better meals.
