        <description>
            <p>According to legend, long ago in a now-forgotten village, there lived a tyrannical mayor. Everyone in the village hated the mayor since they lived in horrible conditions. However, the villagers were too scared to do anything because the mayor was a mighty spellcaster that could pulverize the entire village with a single spell.</p> 
            <p class="indent">One day, the youngest daughter of the village baker decided to do something, but none of the other foodfolk would help her. She knew she couldn't overthrow the mayor alone, so she begged the gods to help her. Alas, no gods heard her prayers. She prayed to the Cook and the Baker. Once again, her prayers went unanswered.</p>
            <p class="indent">Years went by, and one day the mayor came for the girl's family. Desperate to help them, she prayed to the Great Eater as a last resort, asking the entity to devour the mayor once and for all. The mayor laughed in disbelief, but at that very moment, a dark cloud erupted from the girl, smashing everything around her. The mayor gazed upon the young girl in fear while dark clouds gathered around her hand and formed an obsidian ring. Following her instinct, the baker's daughter rushed to the mayor, touched the tyrant's face, and the dark clouds reemerged from the ring in the form of a huge, sharp-toothed maw that devoured the mayor, ending the evil rule that had destroyed so many lives. Believing she had become a hero, the girl looked around expecting to find cheering foodfolk, but was met with the terrified looks on the villagers' faces, looking at her like she was some kind of monster. So she left the village she had saved, wearing the obsidian ring that was aptly named the devouring ring.</p>
            <p class="indent">This ring has 10 charges and it regains 1d8 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing this ring, you can expend its charges to use the following features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><i>Devour (5 Charges).</i></strong> As an action, you can touch a creature and command the ring to devour it.

                <li><strong><i>Dark Clouds (4 Charges).</i></strong> You cast the circle of death spell (DC 15).</li>
                <li><strong><i>Fleeting Glimpse (2 Charges).</i></strong> You cast the misty step spell.</li>

When a creature walks in this area for the first time on a turn, it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or step on a banana peel and fall prone, taking 4d4 bludgeoning damage. The banana peels stay on the ground for 1 minute, then disappear.</p>
