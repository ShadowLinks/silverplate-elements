Insipid Rod
Rod, legendary (requires attunement)

This is a rod made of completely flavorless rusk. While holding the rod, you are tasteless,
can't cast spells, and have immunity to spells. You benefit from this magic item even while
tasteless.

Rod of Butter
Rod, rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer)
Crafted by the sorcerers of the Fryzzle Dynasty (p. 86), the rod of butter is designed to amplify
the effects of certain spells. While holding this rod, you gain a +1
bonus to spell attack rolls and to spell save DCs of your sorcerer spells.
Also, this rod grants you a new Metamagic option.
Buttery Spell. When you cast a damage-dealing spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have
a range of self while holding this rod, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the
spell's level to double the damage (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).

Rod of Vitamins
Rod, uncommon (requires attunement)
This magical glass rod contains healing herbs and remedies to be used in a dangerous situation.
While holding this rod, you can use your bonus action to activate it, sending it to a target of
your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. The rod revolves around the target for 1
minute, during which the target regains 2 hit points at the end of each of its turns. The rod
returns to you at the end of the duration, when you use another bonus action to call it back, or
when you fall unconscious. Once a creature regains 20 hit points with this rod, it must finish a
long rest to be able to regain
hit points in the same way again.
